# random-bash

In here you would most likely find bash scripts that have no use in the real world.

However, I will use this repo as a place to store what I'm writing while I am learning. 

- [http-request.sh] - A script that send a request to a url of choice with the chosen text file
    What I have learned:
    - to work with arrays 
    - how bash is using quotes and for what purpose
    > "" tells bash to keep what's inside as a single argument (even if it contains spaces)
    > '' do the same, except they pass all text verbatim (including double quote characters and the dollar sign)
    > to generate a new url use: https://requestbin.com/r/
